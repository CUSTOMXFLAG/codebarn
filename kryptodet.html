    <p style="font-family: 'Press Start 2P', serif;background: #000000;"><em><span style="color: rgb(255, 130, 250);">Heads Wanted</span></em><br><br><em><span style="color: rgb(253, 255, 130);">Summary:</span></em><br><em><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Designing scripts to determine the probability for outcomes of calculated estimations in a crypto trading environment:Developing visual graphs with thresholds, using knowledge of Technical stocks analysis and testing our calculations with real penny bets on the stock market + automated betting systems development and operation.</span><span style="color: rgb(253, 255, 130);">&nbsp;</span></em><br><br><em><span style="color: rgb(253, 255, 130);">Goal:</span></em><br><em><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Develop a system that is successful enough to ultimately win a place in a prop fund. {Prop fund: people hire others to trade for them, if they know that they will profit. so you can apply for a test with a prop fund to see if you are eligible to be responsible for large funds accounts( a $5000 +&nbsp; account)with that firm. When you successfully trade with their money, You can make a good percentage of the profits you&nbsp; acquired for their firm.</span></em><br><br><em><span style="color: rgb(253, 255, 130);">Justification:</span></em><br><em><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Applying community developed algorithms, and watching trading patterns on day to day and weekly basis can help better guide an understanding of graphs and how things in the day will impact the trade balances throughout the year and by the hour.</span></em><br><br><em><span style="color: rgb(253, 255, 130);">We will (1)perform analysis and calculation on monthly changes in stock prices,(2) revise current events that impact the price in that month, and (3) analyze how and when the stock prices changed throughout the month.</span></em><br><br><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 194, 255);">The objective is not necessarily to profit but to develop an understanding of rates of change in a value representation on todays charts. This project does not need to be successful but it will be good if it works and we expect that in the long run, exposure to this environment will result in real profit, potential for small investing and good inspiration for becoming interested consciously in high corporate entities.</span></em><br><br><em><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">If we can develop a successful algorithm that passes a prop firm test, we can use this to gather funds for this kafe and support individuals opening&nbsp; their own accounts.</span></em><br><br><em><span style="color: rgb(253, 255, 130);">We will have a casual research agenda and not make time restraints. Posts or meets will be initiated when thoughtful ideas are had. A requirement might be to follow and report on the events taking place in at least one stock in the easiest preferable format. Monthly donation programs are optional and have exclusive group benefits related directly to what is purchased collectively by the Kafe.</span></em><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 214, 0);">Positions</span><br><br><em><span style="color: rgb(252, 122, 255);">Note taker</span></em><br><em><span style="color: rgb(122, 207, 255);">Script Writer</span></em><br><em><span style="color: rgb(122, 255, 143);">Tester</span></em><br><em><span style="color: rgb(255, 162, 122);">Researcher</span></em><br><em><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">and more...</span></em><br><br><em><span style="color: rgb(253, 255, 130);">Work on your own ideas and domain- collaborate, share, protect , gas, support , share your work , incorporate ideas ,compare</span></em><br><br><br><br><em><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Come hang out!</span></em><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">----------------------------------------------------</span><br></p>
